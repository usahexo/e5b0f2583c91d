#  How Much Do Casino Workers Help Make in Vegas? 

Casino dealers are the lifeblood of any casino, and in Las Vegas, their wages are good. A gaming surveillance officer may earn up to $50,000 per year, a casino host can make up to $75,000 and even pit bosses make a six-figure salary. But it’s the lowly dealers who get the most attention - and for good reason.

Nevada gaming regulations require that dealers be paid at least $3 per hour above minimum wage (currently $7.25), so they start out making at least $10.25 an hour. In most cases, they make much more than that because tips are a major part of their income.

According to one study, the average dealer in Las Vegas earns about $23 per hour in tips alone. That means they can easily make $50,000 or more working full-time during the busy summer months. 

The best-paid dealers typically work at the high-stakes tables where the big spenders gather. They can take home more than $100,000 per year in tips - and sometimes even more than that if they play their cards right (pun intended). 

So, how much do casino workers make in Vegas? It all depends on what type of dealer you are and where you work. But most of them make a lot more than minimum wage, and many of them bring home well over six figures each year.
