#  How Old is the Double Diamond Port Machine?

This question has been asked time and again but an answer still remains elusive to many. How old really is the Double Diamond Port Machine?

First, let's take a look at what the Double Diamond Port Machine is. It is one of the earliest slot machines ever made and was manufactured by Mills Novelty Company in 1905. It got its name from the two diamonds located at the top of the machine.

Due to its age, it's no surprise that ascertaining an exact date for the Double Diamond Port Machine is difficult. However, there are several clues that can help us come up with a close estimate. For instance, 1905 was the year that electricity began to be used in casinos and this is also when Mills started manufacturing slot machines. So it's safe to say that the Double Diamond Port Machine was likely made in or around 1905.

While we may not be able to pinpoint an exact date, we can at least say that the Double Diamond Port Machine is over 100 years old! It's amazing how well it has held up all these years and continues to be a popular attraction in casinos all around the world.
