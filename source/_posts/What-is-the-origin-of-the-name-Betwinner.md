#  What is the origin of the name Betwinner?

The Betwinner company is a relatively new entrant to the online betting market. The company was founded in 2014 and is licensed in Malta. The company’s name may be familiar to some as it was previously known as Winner Poker.

The company rebranded itself in early 2017 and has been going from strength to strength since then. The Betwinner brand is now one of the most trusted names in online betting and casino gaming.

So, where does the name come from? It’s actually quite a story. The man who founded the company, Grigory Yakhnitsa, is a big believer in luck and good fortune. In fact, his nickname is “the Betwinner”. When he decided to set up his own online betting company, he naturally chose the name Betwinner as a way of conveying his belief that success in life comes down to luck and chance.

And it seems that Grigory has been lucky with his choice of name, as Betwinner has gone on to become one of the most successful online betting companies in the world.
