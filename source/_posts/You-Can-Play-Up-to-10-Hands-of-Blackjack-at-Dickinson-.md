Now that you know the basics of the game, it is time to up your game and start winning. The key to success in blackjack is to first understand the basic rules of the game, and then to employ a winning strategy.

One such strategy is the “Ten Count,” which is based on keeping track of how many high cards are left in the deck. When there are few high cards left, the odds are in your favor. So, if you keep track of how many 10s and face cards remain, you can make smart betting decisions that will increase your chances of winning.

Another strategy to help improve your odds at blackjack is card counting. This involves keeping track of all the cards played, so that you can get an idea of what kinds of cards remain in the deck. This information can help you make better betting choices when it’s time for you to hit or stand.

Finally, always remember to gamble responsibly. Blackjack can be a lot of fun, but it’s important to set strict limits on how much money you’re willing to risk. By following these tips and employing a winning strategy, you could be on your way to winning every hand at Dickinson!
