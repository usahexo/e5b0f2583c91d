#  What is the difference between a caterpillar and a butterfly?

The difference between caterpillars and butterflies is that caterpillars have more legs, whereas butterflies have only two. Caterpillars are also typically a more vibrant green or yellow color, while butterflies are often more muted in color.

#  How do you play the Caterpillars game?

The game of caterpillars is a game that can be played by two or more players. The object of the game is to get your caterpillar to the top of the tree first.

To play, you will need a piece of paper and something to draw a tree with. Draw a tree on the paper, with eight branches. The top of the tree should be at the top of the page. Each branch should be about four inches long.

Draw a caterpillar on one of the branches near the bottom of the tree. Each player takes turns moving their caterpillar up one branch, using only forward and backward moves (no side-to-side moves). The player who gets their caterpillar to the top of the tree wins!

#  What symbol is Wild in the Caterpillars game?

The Wild symbol is denoted by the image of a butterfly in the Caterpillars game. This symbol can replace any other symbol on the reels to help players form winning combinations.

#  What are the bonus features in the Caterpillars game?

The first thing players will likely want to do is try and unlock all of the game's achievements. There are a total of 25 achievements to earn, and they range from the simple (collecting five butterflies) to the more challenging (winning 10 games in a row).

Once all of the achievements have been earned, players can move on to the mini games. There are three mini games in all: A memory game where players must match pictures of different caterpillars, a colour-matching game, and a puzzle game. These mini games are all fairly easy to play but can be challenging enough that they provide some enjoyment for players.

Finally, players can dress up their caterpillars in different accessories. There are over 30 different items to choose from, including hats, glasses, and clothes. Dressing up the caterpillars is just for fun but it's a nice extra touch that provides players with some extra amusement.
