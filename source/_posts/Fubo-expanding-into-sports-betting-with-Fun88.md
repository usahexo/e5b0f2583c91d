#  Fubo expanding into sports betting with Fun88


This week, online sports streaming service FuboTV announced a partnership with UK bookmaker Fun88. The deal will see Fun88 become the exclusive betting partner of Fubo in the United States, and marks Fubo's first foray into the world of sports betting.

The move is a natural one for Fubo, which has been looking to expand its offerings beyond just sports streaming. With Fun88, Fubo now has a ready-made platform for offering bets on sporting events, as well as providing casino games and other forms of gambling.

For Fun88, the deal is a chance to expand its operations in the United States. The company is already well-established in Asia, but this is its first venture into the potentially lucrative US market.

It remains to be seen how successful this partnership will be, but it's clear that both companies are excited about it. In a statement, David Gandler, CEO of FuboTV, said that the deal "represents an important step in our mission to provide fans with the best possible experience across all of their devices." For his part, Edward Chen, CEO of Fun88 USA, said that it was "a privilege" to partner with FuboTV and that he looked forward "to working together to bring our customers the best possible gaming experience."

So far there have been no details released about what types of bets will be available through FuboTV and Fun88. However, it's likely that we can expect a wide range of options, including bets on everything from professional football games to major tournaments like Wimbledon or the World Cup.

FuboTV, a sports-focused streaming TV service, announced today a partnership with Fun88, an online sports betting and gaming company. The new partnership will allow FuboTV customers in select markets to place bets on sporting events through the Fun88 app.

This is the latest move by FuboTV to expand its services beyond traditional TV watching. In recent months, the company has launched a number of new features, including a cloud DVR, enhanced search capabilities, and an interactive program guide.

"We're constantly working to enhance the FuboTV experience for our customers," said David Gandler, co-founder and CEO of FuboTV. "Partnering with Fun88 provides our users with another great way to enjoy their favorite sports."

Fun88 is one of the world's largest online sports betting companies, with more than 10 million customers worldwide. The company offers betting on more than 25 different sports, including soccer, cricket, and tennis.

"We are excited to partner with FuboTV and provide their customers with access to our industry-leading sports betting products," said Roy Ng, head of business development at Fun88. "We look forward to working together to grow the Fun88 brand in the United States."

The collaboration will go into effect immediately in New Jersey and Indiana, where both companies are licensed to offer sports betting. Additional states will be added in the coming weeks.

#  Fun88 to power Fubo's sports betting offering

Fun88, a leading online gambling company, has announced a new partnership with Fubo, the leading sports streaming service in the US.

As part of the deal, Fun88 will power Fubo's sports betting offering, which is scheduled to go live in the coming weeks.

The move will give Fun88 access to Fubo's large user base of sports fans, who will now be able to bet on sporting events through the streaming service.

"We are very excited about this partnership with Fubo," said a spokesperson for Fun88. "We believe that this will be a great opportunity to bring our betting products to a wider audience of sports fans."

#  Fubo and Fun88 partner for expanded gambling offerings

In early 2019, FuboTV, a sports streaming service, announced a partnership with Fun88, a gambling company. The two companies will work together to provide a broad range of gambling services for users in the United States and other countries.

The partnership is a natural fit for both companies. FuboTV has been looking for ways to expand its offerings beyond sports, and Fun88 is looking to break into the American market. The two companies have already begun working together to develop new products.

One of the first products to come out of the partnership is Fun88 Fantasy Sports. This product allows users to compete against each other in fantasy sports contests. Quartersports, a leading fantasy sports company, is powering the product.

“We’re excited to team up with Fun88 and bring our world-class fantasy sports experience to their customers worldwide,” said Amir Goldstein, CEO of Quartersports. “FuboTV has built an impressive platform and we expect that this partnership will attract new users to fantasy sports and help Fun88 grow its business.”

Additional products are expected to be released in the coming months. These products will include casino games, poker tournaments, and sports betting. Fun88 will be responsible for providing the games and content, while FuboTV will handle the distribution and customer support.

The partnership is good news for FuboTV investors. The stock price rose significantly after the announcement was made. Many people are optimistic about the future of the company and believe that this partnership will help it grow even more rapidly.

#  Fubo launching sports betting in partnership with Fun88

FuboTV, the streaming service for sports fans, is set to launch its own sports betting product in partnership with Fun88. This will make Fubo the first major streaming service to offer a standalone sports betting product.

The new product, which is expected to launch in the coming weeks, will allow customers to bet on a variety of sporting events through their FuboTV app. This will include major league sports in the United States such as baseball, basketball, and football, as well as international sporting events like soccer and cricket.

“This is an exciting day for FuboTV and for sports fans across the country who want to be able to place legal bets on their favorite teams and athletes,” said David Gandler, co-founder and CEO of FuboTV.

Fun88 is a leading online gambling company headquartered in the United Kingdom. The company has been operating since 2008 and offers a wide range of gambling products, including casino games, sports betting, and poker.

With this partnership, Fun88 gains access to FuboTV’s more than 2 million active subscribers in the United States. In addition, FuboTV will be able to offer its customers a one-stop shop for all their gambling needs.

“We are thrilled to partner with FuboTV as they enter into the sports betting market. This partnership will give our customers access to one of the most advanced streaming platforms in the world combined with one of the strongest sporting lineups available online today,” said John Wallin, director at Fun88 USA.

Fun88 already has a strong presence in the United States; with this partnership they are looking to expand even further. The company plans to use FuboTV’s extensive customer base and marketing capabilities to attract even more players to its online gambling products.
