For only $10, you could eat all you wanted from the buffet. This is an amazing deal, especially since the buffet has a great selection of food.

There were all sorts of different dishes to choose from, including seafood, chicken, pork, beef, and pasta dishes. There were also a few vegetarian options available.

You can try everything until you find something that grabs your attention.

The desserts at the buffet were also delicious. There was a wide variety to choose from, including cakes, pies, cookies, and even some healthier options like fruit cups and yogurt. If you have a sweet tooth, you'll definitely find something to satisfy your cravings at the buffet.

Overall, I thought the buffet meal ticket deal at California Hotel Casino was an amazing deal. The food is delicious and there's plenty of variety to choose from. If you're looking for a cheap and tasty meal, be sure to check out the buffet at California Hotel Casino!
