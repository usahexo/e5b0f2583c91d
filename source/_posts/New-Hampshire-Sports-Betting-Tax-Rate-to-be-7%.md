#  New Hampshire Sports Betting Tax Rate to be 7%

On Tuesday, the House of Representatives in New Hampshire passed a bill that will impose a 7% tax on sports betting revenues. If the Senate also approves the measure, the tax would go into effect starting in July.

Governor Chris Sununu has voiced his support for the tax,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) stating that it would help to “offset any potential negative consequences” of legalized sports betting. The state is expected to bring in around $5 million in annual revenue from sports betting taxes.

 Gambling opponents have argued that the tax is too high, and could drive gamblers to other states with lower rates. But lawmakers in New Hampshire say that they want to make sure that the benefits of legalized sports betting are shared by all taxpayers.

The vote in the House was largely along party lines, with Republicans supporting the measure and Democrats opposing it. The bill now goes to the Senate for consideration.

#  Pennsylvania Sports Betting Tax Rate to be 34%

Pennsylvania's new tax rate on sports betting will be 34%, highest in the nation. 

The Keystone State was one of the first to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in May. But the high tax rate may keep some casinos from offering sports betting services.

"You're looking at a rate that's double what it is in Nevada," said Dennis Haslam, owner of the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh. "It's going to make it very difficult for us to be profitable." 

State Rep. George Dunbar, who sponsored the legislation, said the tax rate is necessary to help pay for other gambling initiatives in the state, including expanding video gaming terminals at truck stops and casinos. 

"This is not something that anyone wanted to do," Dunbar said. "But it is something that we have to do because of our budgetary situation." 

The 34% tax rate is also higher than what was proposed in neighboring New Jersey, which has a 12% tax rate on sports bets. 

Industry experts predict that Pennsylvania's high tax rate will lead to an increase in illegal sports betting. "The only people making money off of this are going to be bookies," said William Hill US CEO Joe Asher. 

Casinos in Pennsylvania are hopeful that the legislature will reconsider the tax rate before the start of football season in September.

#  Nevada Sports Betting Tax Rate to be 0%

Governor of Nevada, Steve Sisolak, announced on Thursday that the state's tax rate for sports betting will be 0%. This follows news a few days ago that the state would allow betting on sports.

Sisolak said in a statement: "This is great news for Nevadans and for the thousands of people who visit our state each year to enjoy all that we have to offer. I am committed to ensuring that our state remains competitive in this new industry and that Nevadans reap the benefits."

Nevada is one of only two states in the US where gambling is legal statewide. The other is Delaware. Nevada has been a leader in gambling since it legalized casino gaming in 1931.

The move to allow sports betting was spearheaded by the state's Gaming Control Board. Board Chairman A.G. Burnett said in a statement: "This is something that we've been working on for quite some time and we're very pleased with the governor's announcement today."

The law legalizing sports betting requires operators to pay a 6.75% gaming tax on their adjusted gross receipts from bets placed. However, Sisolak has announced that this tax will be waived for operators who have licenses from the board to conduct sports betting.

This puts Nevada in direct competition with New Jersey, which also has a 0% tax rate for sports betting. In contrast, Mississippi has a tax rate of 10%.

#  Delaware Sports Betting Tax Rate Set at 6.75%

Governor John Carney has signed a bill into law that will regulate sports betting in Delaware. The tax rate for sports betting in the state will be 6.75%, which is slightly lower than the tax rate for casinos in Delaware.

The new law will allow for both online and in-person sports betting, and the state is expected to start taking bets within the next few weeks. The regulations are similar to those in place in other states that have legalized sports betting, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

The Delaware Lottery will be responsible for overseeing sports betting in the state, and officials say that they are ready to begin accepting bets. The Lottery plans to launch a website where residents can place bets on sporting events, and it is also expected that there will be authorized retail locations where people can bet in person.

The minimum age for sports betting in Delaware is 18, and residents will be able to bet on events taking place both inside and outside of the United States. In addition to traditional sporting events, residents will also be able to bet on fantasy leagues and other types of contests.

There is some speculation that the new law could lead to an increase in tourism in Delaware, as people travel to states with legalized sports betting to place bets. Officials in the state are hopeful that the new law will help generate additional revenue for Delaware, which has faced budget challenges in recent years.

#  Mississippi Sports Betting Taxes at 8%

In Mississippi, 8 percent tax is applied on every sports betting activity. This is in accordance with the state’s laws which also requires operators to pay a license fee of $5,000. The tax revenue generated from this activity will be used to fund state programs.

This move by the state government is seen as a way of generating additional funds for its various operations. It’s also seen as a way of regulating the industry and ensuring that bettors are protected.

The 8% tax rate applies to both in-person and online sports betting activities. However, there are some exemptions for charitable events and fantasy sports contests.

The move by Mississippi follows similar decisions made by other states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania. These states have been quick to legalize sports betting in light of the Supreme Court ruling earlier this year.
