#  Marseille Looks to Tip the Scale in UEFA Europa League Final

Marseille looks to overturn a 3-1 deficit when they face off against Spanish powerhouse Atlético Madrid in the UEFA Europa League final on Wednesday.

The French side made it to the final after disposing of Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg in the semi-final, while Atlético Madrid defeated English Premier League side Arsenal.

Despite their impressive form in Europe this season, Marseille have been struggling domestically. They currently sit in 10th place in Ligue 1, well behind 4th-placed Lyon and the Champions League qualification spots.

Atlético Madrid, by contrast, are enjoying a good season both domestically and in Europe. They are second in La Liga, just four points behind champions Barcelona, and have reached their third consecutive European Cup final.

Their experience could be decisive on Wednesday, as they bid to win their first Europa League title. Former Chelsea striker Fernando Torres is likely to spearhead their attack, while Antoine Griezmann – who has been linked with a move to Barcelona – will be looking to make an impact.

For Marseille, it is all about stopping those two players if they are to have any chance of pulling off a shock win. Dimitri Payet will be key for them going forward, as will captain Steve Mandanda in goal.

The Europa League has been something of a consolation prize for Atlético Madrid in recent years. They lost the Champions League final in both 2014 and 2016, but winning Europe’s second-tier competition would give them some consolation.

Marseille will be out for revenge, though – not only because of their 3-1 deficit but also because of Atlético Madrid’s victory over them in the 2010 UEFA Super Cup. That match was decided by a Diego Forlán penalty shootout goal.

#  Olympique de Marseille: A Club on the Rise

Formed in 1899, Olympique de Marseille have a long and storied history. The French club has won the Ligue 1 championship nine times and the Coupe de France five times. However, in recent years, Marseille have been on the rise, reaching the Europa League final in 2013 and again in 2017.

This resurgence can largely be attributed to club president Jacques-Henri Eyraud, who took over in 2016. Eyraud has brought in top talent such as Dimitri Payet, Luiz Gustavo, and Radamel Falcao while also making shrewd managerial appointments, such as hiring former Borussia Dortmund manager Rudi Garcia.

Under Garcia’s guidance, Marseille reached the Europa League final in 2017 only to fall to Spanish powerhouse Atlético Madrid. However, this season has seen even more progress from Marseille, with the team currently challenging for first place in Ligue 1. With world-class players like Payet and Falcao at their disposal, Olympique de Marseille are definitely a club on the rise.

#  Behind the Scenes of What Exactly is a Tip Bet in Blackjack Olympique De Marseille
 



  Blackjack is a casino game that involves betting against the house. The goal of the game is to draw cards totaling closer to 21 than the dealer, without going over. If the player surpasses 21, then he or she loses automatically. In addition to cash bets, players may also bet on whether they will be dealt a certain card value – such as an ace, king, queen etc. This is called a "tip bet" and it pays out different odds depending on the casino.
 
  So what are the different tip bet odds at different casinos? Well, it really depends on the casino and game type. Generally speaking, tip bets on blackjack offer better odds than regular bets, but not by much. For example, while most blackjack games offer 3-2 odds on a blackjack (meaning players get back $3 for every $2 they wager), some casinos may offer 4-1 odds on a blackjack instead. In other words, if you bet $10 on a blackjack at 4-1 odds, you would get back $40 plus your original $10 stake – for a total of $50. 
  As you can see, tipping the dealer doesn't offer great odds compared to other bets in blackjack – but it does come with two main benefits. First, it's a way of expressing thanks for good service. And second, it's a way of increasing your chances of winning slightly without making any extra riskier moves. So if you're comfortable with your current game strategy and don't want to take any unnecessary risks, tipping the dealer is probably a good option for you!

Best Tip #1: Find a Good Casino

This may seem like common sense, but finding a good casino is essential if you want to make money playing blackjack. Not only do you want a casino with favourable rules (such as offering double down after splitting), but you also want one with decent customer service and plenty of table options.

One way to figure out whether or not a casino is right for you is to read reviews online. Of course, nothing beats personal experience, so be sure to try out several different casinos before settling on one that works best for you.

Best Tip #2: Practice Card Counting

Card counting is one of the most popular techniques used by blackjack players in order to gain an edge over the house. While it takes some practice to get good at card counting, it can be well worth your time once you have mastered it.

There are many resources available online which can help teach you how to count cards, so be sure to do some research before getting started. Remember that card counting is not illegal, but casinos may ask you to leave if they suspect that you are doing it.

Best Tip #3: Don’t Gamble More Than You Can Afford To Lose


This may seem like common sense as well, but gambling more money than you can afford to lose can lead to disaster. When playing blackjack (or any other casino game), always set yourself a limit and stick to it. This way, you won’t end up losing more money than you intended and will be able to walk away from the table while still in profit.

#  Could a Tip Bet be the Key to Winning at Blackjack?

When playing blackjack, one of the most important decisions you will make is how much money to bet on each hand. You want to make sure that you are betting an amount that gives you the best chance of winning, while also ensuring that you have enough money left to continue playing if you lose a few hands in a row.

One strategy for deciding how much money to bet is to use a tip bet. A tip bet is a small amount of money that you bet on each hand in addition to your main bet. The idea is that the tip bet will help you to win more money in the long run, even if you lose some of the time.

There are two main ways to use a tip bet: as an insurance policy or as a way to increase your chances of winning.

As an insurance policy, the tip bet acts as a safeguard in case you lose your main bet. For example, if you place a $10 bet and also place a $1 tip bet, then you will lose $11 if you lose the hand but only lose $10 if you win the hand. This can help to protect your bankroll in case of a bad streak.

As a way to increase your chances of winning, the tip bet is used like an extra credit card at a casino. For example, if you place a $10 bet and also place a $1 tip bet, then your total bets for that hand are now $11. This increases your chances of winning because it means that the dealer has less chance of getting 21 when they hit.

So should you be using a tipbet when playing blackjack? The answer depends on how comfortable you feel with using it and how much risk you are willing to take. If used correctly, a tipsbet can be a great way increase your chances of winning and protect your bankroll; but remember, there is always risk involved when gambling!
