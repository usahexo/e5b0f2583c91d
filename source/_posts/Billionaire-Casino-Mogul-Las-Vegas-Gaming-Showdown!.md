#  Billionaire Casino Mogul Las Vegas Gaming Showdown!

In what is being called the "battle of the billionaires," casino mogul Steve Wynn is set to square off against Sheldon Adelson in a high-stakes poker match in Las Vegas.

The two have a long history of rivalry, with Wynn accusing Adelson of having "a Midas touch for losing money" in the casino business.

Both men are said to be avid poker players, and the competition is expected to be fierce. The winner is set to take home millions of dollars, and bragging rights for years to come.

Wynn has already declared that he plans to "clean Adelson's clock," but the 80-year-old billionaire isn't about to go down without a fight.

This promises to be one of the most exciting matchups in recent memory, and fans are eagerly anticipating the showdown. Who will come out on top? Only time will tell!

#  Parx Casino in Bensalem Largest in PA - So Who Will Win?

Now that Parx Casino in Bensalem has announced it is the largest casino in Pennsylvania, the competition is heating up. Who will win this race?

The number one contender is obviously Mohegan Sun Pocono in Wilkes-Barre. It’s been the state’s largest casino since it opened in 2006 and has an annual gaming revenue of $272 million. In comparison, Parx Casino’s gaming revenue was only $236 million last year.

So why might Parx Casino be able to take the top spot? For one, its new expansion gives it plenty of extra room to attract more customers. The casino now features 2,500 slot machines and 125 table games, compared to 1,600 slot machines and 66 table games at Mohegan Sun Pocono. Additionally, Parx Casino has made a big commitment to online gaming; it became the first Pennsylvania casino to offer real-money online gambling in November 2017.

Another important factor is that Parx Casino is located relatively close to Philadelphia, while Mohegan Sun Pocono is about two hours away from the city. This means that Philly residents have an easier time getting to Parx Casino than they do to Mohegan Sun Pocono.

There are also other smaller casinos that could give Mohegan Sun Pocono a run for its money. Sands Bethlehem, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, and Mount Airy Resort Casino are all contenders. However, with gaming revenues of $191 million, $211 million, and $152 million respectively, they still have some catching up to do.

#  Could the Biggest Winner of the Night Come from PA's Parx Casino?

There's a lot of talk in the horse racing world about who will take home the biggest purse at this year's Belmont Stakes. But what about the other big race on the calendar?

The $1 million Parx Casino Big Stakes is coming up on July 8, and there are plenty of contenders vying for the top prize. Could this be the race that delivers the biggest upset of the year?

2017 has already seen its fair share of surprises, so it's anyone's guess who might come out on top at Parx Casino. One thing is for sure: there will be plenty of competition among the field of horses.

Here are a few of the horses to watch out for in this year's race:

#1 - Creative Cause: This horse has had a bit of a rough go recently, but he still has one of the best records in the field. He'll definitely be looking to pick up a win at Parx Casino.

#2 - Diversify: This horse had an incredible finish at the 2017 Belmont Stakes, and he's looking to keep that momentum going with a win at Parx Casino.

#3 - Always Dreaming: If this horse can recapture his early-season form, he could be hard to beat at Parx Casino. Keep an eye on him as we get closer to race day.

#  Billionaires Battle it Out at Casino just Outside Philadelphia

The opulent Revel Casino, which looms just outside Philadelphia, has been the scene of a recent billionaire showdown. Steve Wynn, the outspoken founder and CEO of Wynn Resorts, squared off against Carl Icahn, the 77-year-old owner of several billion-dollar businesses, including investment firm Icahn Enterprises.

The battle began when Wynn accused Icahn of having an unfair advantage at the casino due to his ownership of multiple gaming licenses. This gave him access to different tables and games, allowing him to make more money gambling.

Icahn hit back by accusing Wynn of hypocrisy, claiming that the casino tycoon had himself secured multiple gaming licenses in order to give himself an edge over competitors. He also alleged that Wynn had engaged in insider trading in violation of securities laws.

The argument quickly escalated into a public relations battle, with each man taking to the airwaves and newspapers to lob scathing insults at the other. The two billionaires even took their fight to Twitter, where they traded hostile messages with one another.

Revel Casino has refused to comment on the feud between its two owners, but it is clear that the battle is doing damage to the resort's reputation. Customers are staying away in droves, and the casino is losing millions of dollars every day.

It is unclear who will win this Battle of Billionaires, but one thing is for sure: neither side is likely to come out unscathed.

#  Parx Casino Ready to Crown a Champion - Who do you think will win?

The Parx Casino in Bensalem is set to crown a new slots champion this weekend. The casino has been running a contest for the past few months, and the finalists have now been announced. There are six contestants remaining, and they will all be vying for the top prize of $50,000.

The finalists include:

* Tracy from Warminster * Stephanie from Levittown * Chris from Feasterville * Kimberly from Southampton * Catherine from Philadelphia * Neil from Bensalem

The final round of the contest will take place this Saturday, March 10th. The contestants will be competing on the 66-machine “Crown Jewels” game bank. The winner will be the player who spins the highest payout combination.

In order to qualify for the final round, each contestant had to spin a minimum of $1,000 on the Crown Jewels game bank between February 1st and March 9th. The six finalists have each spun well over that amount, with Tracy having racked up an impressive $10,600 on the machines.

So who do you think is going to take home the top prize? My money is on Stephanie from Levittown. She’s been playing at Parx for over 10 years and knows how to hit those high payouts!
