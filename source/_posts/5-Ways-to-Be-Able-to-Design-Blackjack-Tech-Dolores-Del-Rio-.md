#  5 Ways to Be Able to Design Blackjack Tech Dolores Del Rio 

There are many different blackjack tech designers in the world, but only a few who are able to design blackjack tech successfully. The following are five important tips that can help you be one of them:

1. Be familiar with the game and its rules.

The first and most important step in learning how to design blackjack tech is to actually understand the game itself. You need to know the basic rules and understand how the different hands are played out in order to create a workable strategy. Without this fundamental knowledge, it will be very difficult for you to create any kind of successful design.

2. Study other successful designs.

Once you have a good understanding of the game itself, it’s time to start studying other successful designs. There are many different blackjack tech strategies out there, and each one has its own unique set of strengths and weaknesses. By studying these strategies, you can learn what works and what doesn’t, as well as identify any holes in your own design.

3. Test your design thoroughly.

No matter how well-crafted your strategy may be, it’s never going to be perfect until you actually test it out in the real world. This means playing countless hands against live opponents and making any necessary tweaks along the way. Only by doing this can you ensure that your design is as strong as possible and has a good chance of beating the house edge.

4. Be prepared to make adjustments.

Even after extensive testing, your blackjack tech design is likely to require occasional adjustments based on the ever-changing landscape of the game itself. New casinos or rule changes can easily upset even the best-laid plans, so it’s essential to be prepared for these eventualities and make the necessary changes on-the-fly.

5. Have patience and persistence.

Designing a successful blackjack tech strategy takes time and patience – two qualities that are absolutely essential for anyone hoping to make it big in this field. If you can’t handle frustration or don’t have enough drive to keep working at it until you achieve success, then this may not be the right career for you

#  advice from blackjack designer dolores del rio

There are a lot of blackjack myths and superstitions around, but what really works? Here’s some advice from professional blackjack designer Dolores del Rio:

- Bet low when you have a weak hand. The dealer has an advantage over players with weaker hands, so betting low will give you more chances to win.

- Stay away from insurance bets. These bets may seem like a smart way to protect your hand, but the odds are actually against you when you make them.

- Hit on soft 17. This rule gives you a better chance of winning than standing on soft 17.

- Split pairs of Aces and 8s. When you split these pairs, you double your chances of winning.

- Avoid doubling down on 10 or 11. These bets are less likely to win than other options.
